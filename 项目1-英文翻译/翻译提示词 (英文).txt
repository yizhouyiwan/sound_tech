Large language models (LLMs) are powerful AI systems trained on vast text data. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a training method where an AI agent learns by trial and error, receiving rewards for desired actions. Combining them, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes LLMs using human preferences, significantly improving their alignment, safety, and helpfulness in real-world applications.
